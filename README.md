# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

### Tests

Run `npm test`.

Some tests only run if an env var is set:

`RUN_E2E_TESTS=true npm test`

or 

`RUN_E2E_TESTS=true npx mocha built/test/e2e.js` for just the e2e tests.


### Running Stryker.js Mutation Testing Locally

Run `npz stryker run --config-file stryker.conf.js` in the root directory of the project.

Stryker.js will perform mutation testing and provide a report on the code coverage.

# Features & Status

## Joining Games

- **Limit number of players in a game:** Implemented (currently hardcoded to 4 per game).
- **Owner sets player limit when game is created:** Not implemented. Player limit is global.
- **Cannot join twice with the same user session/username in the same game:** Implemented.
- **User session may be joined to many games:** Possible. The system does not restrict a user from joining multiple different games.

## Game World

- **API to get state of the world for a given turn (for a specific player):**
  - The client application expects an endpoint like `GET /games/{gameId}/players/{playerId}` which would return the current game state (world, turn, etc.) for that player.
  - The backend service `GameService.turnResults` provides results of a completed turn, but a dedicated endpoint to fetch the full current game state for a player (as if they just joined or are refreshing) would be beneficial for the client.
