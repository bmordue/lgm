# Swagger generated server

## Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub. All API endpoints have been made idempotent, meaning that making two identical requests to any endpoint will result in identical responses and no change in internal state.

### Running the server

To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

### Tests

Run `npm test`.
Some tests only run if an env var is set:

`RUN_E2E_TESTS=true npm test`

or

`RUN_E2E_TESTS=true npx mocha built/test/e2e.js` for just the e2e tests.

### Running Stryker.js Mutation Testing Locally

Run `npz stryker run --config-file stryker.conf.js` in the root directory of the project.

Stryker.js will perform mutation testing and provide a report on the code coverage.

# TODO

Joining games

- should limit number of players in a game
- owner sets player limit is set when game is created
- cannot join twice with the same user session
- user session may be joined to many games

Game world

- API to get state of the world for a given turn

## Idempotency in API Endpoints

To ensure idempotency in our API endpoints, we have implemented checks in our service layer to prevent the creation of duplicate resources. For instance, when a request is made to create a game, the service first checks if a game already exists. If it does, the existing game is returned instead of creating a new one. This ensures that multiple identical requests do not result in the creation of multiple games, thus maintaining idempotency.
