## 2025-05-15 - Redundant ARIA Attributes
**Learning:** `aria-required="true"` is redundant when the HTML5 `required` attribute is already present. Modern screen readers automatically derive the required state from the native attribute.
**Action:** Use only the native `required` attribute for form fields to keep the DOM clean and avoid redundancy.

## 2025-05-15 - Lockfile Management
**Learning:** Running `pnpm install` in individual directories (`api/`, `client/`) may generate new `pnpm-lock.yaml` files. These should not be committed unless new dependencies were explicitly added, as they can be very large and clutter PRs.
**Action:** Always check for and discard unintended lockfile changes before submitting.
